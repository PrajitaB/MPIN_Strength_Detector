# MPIN Strength Detector (4-digit / 6-digit)

- Developed a lightweight, real-time security engine to evaluate the strength of user-entered MPINs (4-digit or 6-digit) and classify them as Weak or Strong.
- The model identifies vulnerabilities by detecting commonly used patterns (sequential, repetitive, mirror-based, coupling, arithmatic progression, etc.) and demographic combinations to prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and unethical hacking attempts.
- This engine can be seamlessly integrated into websites, mobile apps, or authentication systems, providing instant warnings to users and reducing the risk of compromised credentials.

#### In summary, the MPIN Strength Detector offers a fast, reliable, and integration-ready solution for proactively preventing security breaches caused by weak PIN usage. Its hybrid approach ensures both well-known vulnerabilities from demographic data and emerging weak patterns are detected, making it a practical security enhancement for authentication systems.
